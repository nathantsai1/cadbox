# cadbox

# Description

I wanted to make a CAD box, and learn how to add multiple components. In this part, I learned how to copy/paste to remove redundancies, and how to add hinges, which were based off the door handles

# What does it do?

* makes a hinged box
  With:
    * 4 'doors' that open outward
    * a base
    * shock pads that theoretically should work
* There is a lid

# How big is it?
* wXlXh: 100X100X82 mm

# How long did I spend?

I spent about 20 hours

# How to use?

Import the STL file in the 3D slicing system of your choice, and print it(if you would like to do that)
If you want to edit this, import the .STEP file in the CAD system of your choice, and continue to edit the projects
For both, you must import each seperately
