# cadbox

# Description

I wanted to make a CAD box, and learn how to add multiple components. In this part, I learned how to copy/paste to remove redundancies, and how to add hinges, which were based off the door handles

# What does it do?

* makes a hinged box
  With:
    * 4 'doors' that open outward
    * a base
    * shock pads that theoretically should work
* There is a lid

# How big is it?
* wXlXh: 100X100X82 mm

# How long did I spend?

I spent about 20 hours
